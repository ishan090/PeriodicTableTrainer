# Periodic Table Helper

This program is basically a simple loop which asks questions relating to the periodic table.
I noticed that many people find it difficult to work with the periodic table, so this could help them get a better understanding of the whole periodic table

# Data source
The periodic table data for this program was taken from https://gist.github.com/GoodmanSciences/c2dd862cd38f21b0ad36b8f96b4bf1ee

Thanks and hope this is useful!
